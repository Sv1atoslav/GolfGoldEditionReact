                Becoming a golf member opens a wide range of options for the amatuer golfer. It may be that you just

                obtain a credible handi-cap that updates your playing level wherever you play or that you want to play
                in
                professionaly run tournaments that do not exclude you because you do not belong to a Club or both.
